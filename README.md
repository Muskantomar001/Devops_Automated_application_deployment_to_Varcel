# Python script to create Azure DevOps CI/CD Pipeline and deploy it to Vercel 

The Vercel Deployment Extension allows you to automatically deploy to Vercel from Azure DevOps Pipelines. You can add the extension to your Azure DevOps Projects through the Visual Studio marketplace.

Once the Vercel extension is set up, your Azure DevOps project is connected to your Vercel Project. You can then use your Azure Pipeline(s) inside your Azure DevOps project to trigger a Vercel Deployment.

Using Python script, automate the deployment of CI/CD pipeline in Azure DevOps project and deploying the code to Vercel.
